# How to Contribute

We warmly welcome contributions and recognize the value of your efforts.

Before proceeding with an issue or pull request, kindly review our contribution guidelines.

## Respect and Appreciation

As an open-source initiative, this project thrives on the voluntary efforts of our maintainers. Their dedication brings this code to the community, hoping it aids fellow developers. Misdirected frustration or disrespect towards their contributions contradicts the spirit of open-source generosity.

When interacting with maintainers, please approach with respect and understanding. This reinforces the notion that developers are skilled but also generous and respectful individuals.

Maintainers are tasked with ensuring that all contributions enhance the project's value. Developer skills vary widely; thus, it's crucial to honor the maintainer's decisions, even if your contribution isn't incorporated.

## Consideration for Others

When proposing or implementing new features, assess their potential utility to others. Open-source projects serve a diverse audience with varying requirements. Ensure your contributions are likely to benefit other users.

## Guidelines for Issues and Contributions

Before reporting an issue:

- Confirm the issue can be reproduced to ensure it wasn't a one-off error.
- Verify your feature idea hasn't already been implemented or suggested.
- Please take a look through the pull requests to see if there's an ongoing effort to address your concern.

Before submitting a pull request:

- Search the codebase to ensure someone else hasnâ€™t implemented your feature.
- Review open pull requests to avoid duplicating efforts.

## Additional Guidelines

Specific requirements set by the project maintainer are listed here:

- **[PSR-12 Coding Standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-12-extended-coding-style-guide.md)** - Adhering to these conventions is made simpler with [PHP Code Sniffer](http://pear.php.net/package/PHP_CodeSniffer).

- **Testing is optional** - Patches without tests will considered but may not be accepted.

- **Document behavioral changes** - Ensure the `README.md` and any other documentation accurately reflect any changes.

- **Mind our release pattern** - We aim to adhere to [SemVer v2.0.0](http://semver.org/). Avoid making breaking changes to public APIs without due consideration.

- **One feature per pull request** - If you have multiple contributions, please submit them separately.

- **Maintain a clean commit history** - Ensure your pull request's commits are meaningful. If your development process involves several small commits, [squash them](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) before submission.

**We look forward to your contributions**!
